 to be as exact as possible to ensure that it would reflect enough light to fry some potatoes i wanted to do more than boil water with my cooker the hot plate grill was to be constructed out of conduit and bike rims we would flatten the ends of the conduit for easier attachment to the center pipe and rims and then bolt it all together we decided that a gimble would be the best for this project so that we could move the pan or pot in any direction necessary to receive optimal sunlight this is a more difficult design but it gives the dish more freedom and a higher heating capacity we began the project by testing a dish that bart had at the bike library it was slightly oblong and wasnt concave much so we decided to test how accurate the focus was i taped a few pieces of mylar on it and bart and i took it out into the sun it turned out that the dish had many foci because of its oblong shape i had to set out to find another dish if i wanted to be able to fry food with it the one we had just wasnt going to cut it thats when i made a trip to arcata scrap and salvage and found the perfect dish for my project  final construction  can you see the light reflecting on my hand getting ready  sawing off the old mount pole we started by disassembling the focal point of the dish there was an awkward pole sticking out of the center which was not appropriate for the design we were going for we got a grinder out and sawed through the metal so that we could manipulate the pipe into a hot plate grill since the pole was bent near the base we figured that it might not work for our design specifics luckily we found that we could remove the pole by loosening a bolt at the base and that allowed for it to slide right out we were able to locate a longer pole later on but at the time we were planning on using the one that came with the dish we also had to remove a bunch of miscellaneous pipes and widgets sticking out the back side of the dish they were things that helped keep the dish balanced in place but were not needed in our design after that the dish was ready to for transformation  the hot plate grill the next step was to construct a hot plate grill the original focal point was somewhere between 2731 but we forgot exactly in order to make the mount we needed to know how long to make it so i decided to find the theoretical focus by using the formula x24py it worked out to be 29 34 we decided that it would be best if we used conduit to form a v shape and then fit in a few bike rims for the hot plate we had to flatten the ends of the conduit and make sure that they were the right angle for the focus this was done using a clamp and we were able to bend both pieces of conduit at the same time the conduit pipes were a little too long so we had to shorten them using a sawzall at the bike library after the sizing it was time to drill some holes using a pedal powered drill press we discovered that the center pipe we wanted to use was slightly shorter than we wanted but being that we were in such a resourceful area we rummaged around and found a pipe that was the perfect size and width the next step was to drill holes in the flattened sides of the conduit and our newlyfound pipe and fit the pieces together they fit quite nicely we had to make sure that both the conduit pipes were bent at the same angle or else the structure would be unstable the next step was to drill holes in the bike rim so that we could bolt it to the mount structure we just created we drilled the holes using a

 at the hsu sculpture lab and it was ready to be bolted together      drilling holes in the conduit using pedal power       making sure the conduit is bent at the right angle       sizing down the mount pole       now all we have to do is bolt it all together     the mirror finish bart had acquired a bunch of sheet metal that he had wanted to use on a previous project but decided that my dish could use them there wasnt quite enough cut pieces to cover the entire surface area of the dish and i had to take some scrap sheet aluminum to the hsu sculpture lab to cut them into triangular shapes after they had been cut they needed to be prepared for riveting it took about a half an hour to drill holes in all of the pieces and they were quickly ready to be fastened to the dish while putting the pieces in place we noticed that the holes we had drilled did not always match the pattern of the mesh and there were areas where the mesh was covered with pieces of solid metal these areas had to be dealt with differently in some areas we were able to drill holes through the metal for the rivets and in others we devised a way of using a thin wire to attach the pieces i used a paperclip i found on the ground and stuck it through the hole and then through the mesh slightly above the triangle using pliers i twisted the ends of the paperclip to form a tight grasp on the metal it worked quite well i was also able to get rivets with a larger gripping range and that helped with the thicker areas after the pieces were all riveted into place we noticed that there was a gap  there wasnt quite enough sheet metal to cover the whole dish i drilled some more holes in the scrap pieces i had and was able to fasten them to the dish theres still a little gap but that really wont matter since the dish is so big and most of it is coated anyway the last step was to buff the

 to a sweet finish   more pedal powerbart orlando mentoring  getting measurements to calculate the focus the final product now the dish is ready for cookin it could use a little shining up with some citrasol or something of that nature but even without a shine job the focus gets pretty hot in terms of setting the dish up all we need is to lean it up on something theres a mount on the back of it with the capability of being staked in the ground for that i would have to find a long piece of pipe about 3 12 in diameter and at least 14 thick      the final product       the finished hot plate grill     testing my solar cooker is spectacular for cooking veggie burgers and beans at 100 pm the dish heats up to 400 of around 200300 pm the dish heats up to 350 of ive found that the cooker doesnt burn food too easily when ive forgotten abut something thats cooking the sun moves in the sky that automatically reduces the heat at the focus things have gotten caramelized but its hard to burn something  final costs   quantity  materials  source  cost   total    1  satellite dish  arcata scrap and salvage  40  40   1  rivets and washers  hensel ace hardware  25  25   1  other parts  donated  0  0   total cost  65  everything else we had lying around at the bike library and was free ie nuts  bolts bike rims pipes tools bart gave me sheet metal that he was going to use for a different dish so that i could make mine  conclusions the first time you construct a solar cooker you learn a lot in terms of what methods and materials to incorporate in construction the next cooker i make will probably be a lot easier since ive already been through it next time i would like to use a lighter aluminum for the mirror finish the dish is relatively light for its size but its certainly difficult to handle on your own i would also consider a dish without reinforcing structures they got in the way when i was riveting and as unable to attach the aluminum in some areas in order to be exact the mirror finish needs to coat the entire surface area of the dish this increases the heat capacity but considering my dishs size i dont think that it will have a hard time reaching high temperatures and it hasnt ive been cooking lunch with it for the past few days now without a shine job on the sheet

  discussion this project was the coolest thing ive done all year cooking food with my solar cooker is the best feeling in the world its cool to see something that i created work so well the thing that i would like to add is a mount pole for the back of the dish i am able to lean it up against a chair and stuff like that but if i have to put it up at a hard angle i might have a little more trouble so thats something ill have to think about but for now im having a blast in the afternoons cooking gardenburgers and fried potatoes  things to keep in mindcommon errors to avoid watch out for stray rays of light that come off your cooker they could possibly start a fire if you arent careful it isnt much of a worry if your dish is more concave but the flatter the dish is the more likely that you will have stray rays of light wear sunglasses when cooking because it gets really bright and hard for your eyes to handle use a castiron or some other type of black cooking potpan any other color might reflect the light and thats not what you want the black absorbs the light and brings the temperature up in the potpan author useraleiha see also compound parabolic concentrators compound parabolic reflectors for solar cookers parabolic solar cookers how to build a paraboloid generate the diagram needed to build a paraboloid from a flat sheet given the distance from the vertex to the focus other solar cooker plans links projects with bart free and easy diy parabolic solar concentrator plan how to harness suns energy by making a solar concentrator how to make a solar oven vtesolar topics categorygreenhousesgeneralcomposting greenhouse provides hot water · construction of an affordable greenhouse · humboldt greenhouse gallerytoolskivas straw bale greenhouse · sequatchie valley institute cobb houses · sunny brae middle school garden · greenhouse waste heat exchangepassive solargeneraldirect gain · parras passive solar design gallery · thermal mass · thermosiphon · passive annual heat storagetoolstrombe wallsphotovoltaicsgeneralashrae pvt · amorphous silicon pvt · an open source simulation of photovoltic yield for southeastern ontario · ccat pv system energy analysis · combined photovoltaic solar thermal systems pvt  literature review · deployment of renewable energy technologies to mitigate climate change literature review · distributed generation · diverting indirect subsidies from the nuclear to the photovoltaic industry energy and financial returns · effects of substrate temperature on indium gallium nitride nanocolumn crystal growth · effects of low concentration planer concentrators on arrayscale solar photovoltaic systems performance · effects of snow on photovoltaic performance · electrical wiring and switching · estimating the rooftop pv potential of a largescale geographical region · extracting data from the ilc · government investment and pv manufacturing  lit review · government pv manufacturing policy lit review · government support of photovoltaic manufacturing · green building preapprenticeship programsolar pv installation and design principles · grid connection · holographic solar · humboldt photovoltaic gallery · ingan solar cells literature review · industrial symbiosis in photovoltaic manufacturing · lca of silicon pv panels · levelised cost of electricity literature review · leveraging solar photovoltaic technology for sustainable development in ontarios aboriginal communities · lifespan and reliability of solar photovoltaics  literature review · low level concentration for pv applications · lunar solar power generation · mech820 · maintenance of your solar electric system · modeling shading for pv system · open solar outdoors test field · pv and chp literature review · pv and chp hybrid systems · pv penetration level literature review · parras solar gallery · peer to peer lending and microfinance for solar  lit review · photovoltaic system at st judes church · producer responsibility and recycling solar photovoltaic modules · programming a cr1000 datalogger · queens innovation park test site · refrigeration for developing countries · regional rooftop solar photovoltaic potential literature review · renewable powered desalination in coastal central and southern vietnam · rural lighting · searc osotf design and operations manual · solar pv refrigeration of vaccines · solar pv waterpumping · solar photovoltaic pv energy · solar photovoltaic cells for the kingston home faq · solar photovoltaic open lectures · solar radiation maps · solar powered internet cafe in
